## Community Participation Guidelines

We are a team of developer advocates that work to provide resources for Developers to Get, Build, and Analyze Data to make data simple and accessible on the IBM Watson Data Platform. These participation guidelines describe the type of communities the Developer Advocates on the IBM Watson Data Platform are building. 
 
These Community Participation Guidelines apply to anyone who contributes to the IBM Watson Data Platform Community in IBM-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, web sites, IRC channels, bugs, events, conferences, Stack Overflow responses, public meetings or person to person, IBM-related correspondence.
