  headline: An example web app using OpenWhisk and Cloudant.
  story:    “Serverless” means that instead of having fixed numbers of dedicated machines sitting in data centres waiting for traffic to come in, we can supply the code that handles a single piece of work (e.g. the submission of a web form) to an application framework like IBM OpenWhisk and let it scale out the computing power required. If no traffic arrives, you don’t pay anything — no fixed costs!
