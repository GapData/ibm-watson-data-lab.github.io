"Get Connected" represents our body of work on how to start interacting with various open source databases, in the context of specific sample applications, software languages, and database drivers. Why?

Open source databases provide flexibility. Not just to stay up-to-date with the latest software updates or to develop your own features, but to ensure that you have the option of running your database wherever you want and never be locked into a particular company or platform. They also provide lots of documentation, configuration, and options. That can be a good thing for experienced users, but it can be overwhelming for new users looking for simple examples. That's where we come in. We're here to get you started.
