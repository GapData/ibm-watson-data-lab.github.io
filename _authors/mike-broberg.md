Mike worked in tech PR for many moons before starting to work with Cloudant in 2012. He joined Cloudant's marketing team full-time in 2013 and is now happily ensconced in the IBM WDP developer advocacy team, where he edits articles, QAs demo apps, and helps other peeps learn what's up with dev advocacy.
