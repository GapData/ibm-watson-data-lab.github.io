Raj is a Developer Advocate and Geo specialist at IBM. He specializes in all things geospatial, data science hacking with Spark and Python, and data wrangling, shaping and cleaning. He's currently driven to make the IBM Cloud the best place to obtain and exploit comprehensive, curated open data sets for business. Raj pioneered Web mapping-as-a-service in the late 1990s with Syncline, a startup he co-founded.
