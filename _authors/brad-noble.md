I consider myself the most fortunate person at IBM. I recruit, work with, and learn from the authors of the The Watson Data Lab, who are amonng the most interesting, talented, and ambitious technologists I've met. Formerly, I ran product design at Cloudant (acquired by IBM), and was the founder of PostPost, now defunct, which was an early social search engine.
