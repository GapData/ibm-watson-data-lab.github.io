## Support for Conferences and Events

The Developer Advocacy team at IBM Watson Data Platform values the safety and security of our users and the communities they participate in. While our Code of Conduct covers any events that our team funds, we will also not sponsor conferences and events that have not implemented a code of conduct specifically addressing harassment and discrimination. We want to be sure that any events we fund have policies and procedures in place for handling harassment. It's especially important to us that real-life events take steps to protect the physical and mental security of their participants. An acceptable code of conduct meets the following criteria:

<ul class="browser-default">
	<li>Applies to all participants (organizers, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, project contributors, etc.)</li>
	<li>Outlines behavior that is considered unacceptable</li>
	<li>Makes clear the consequences of unacceptable behavior</li>
	<li>Outlines an incident response plan</li>
	<li>Promotes their Code of Conduct through multiple channels:
		<ul class="browser-default">
			<li>Prominently on the event website</li>
			<li>During registration</li>
			<li>Communications with attendees, speakers, etc.</li>
			<li>Signage at the event</li>
	    </ul>
    </li>
	<li>Provides multiple ways to report an incident
		<ul class="browser-default">
			<li>Email</li>
			<li>Anonymous</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
</ul>

For an example code of conduct that meets these requirements, we recommend [this template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) as a starting point, but we're also open to alternatives.
