Watson services are smart, but you can make them even smarter with data. You can use data to drive your Watson services, or use output from Watson services to enhance your data, drive better user experiences, or gain insights into your business.

Here are some of the ways Watson and data can be BFFs: 

{:.browser-default}
- Persist chatbot interactions from [Watson Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/) to drive more personal experiences for your users.
- Analyze chatbot interactions using Apache Spark&trade; and Jupyter notebooks to gain insights into your users.
- Enhance your data sets and machine learning models with sentiment and emotion from [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/).
- Extract entities, categories, and keywords from your data sets using [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/).
- Use your data sets to build and train [Watson Retrieve and Rank](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/retrieve-and-rank/) for enhanced information retrieval.

## Getting started

We are constantly exploring new ways to augment Watson services with data. Here are some of the things we have built so far:

* If you are interested in building chatbots with Watson Conversation check out [Persisting Data for a Smarter Chatbot](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/persisting-data-for-a-smarter-chatbot-be599480f7b2).
