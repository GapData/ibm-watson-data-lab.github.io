		<p>A natural extension of Responsive web design and Mobile First thinking, which treat
		screen size as your primary design constraint, Offline First treats the flakiness of
		wireless networks as a given. Using the data replication and sync capabilities of Apache
		CouchDB™, PouchDB, and IBM Cloudant, we’ll show you how to build Offline First
		principles into your apps so they’re not only highly available, but load faster and
		perform better too.</p>
