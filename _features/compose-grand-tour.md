The Grand Tour is a [Compose project](https://www.compose.com/articles/starting-the-compose-grand-tour/) to maintain examples that cover connecting and working with every Compose database across a wide range of languages and drivers.

## Driven by an example

We started with a simple idea. Create an example that's more than "Hello World", something that works on the web and won't need to be re-engineered for each language. The idea is that once you know what the example does, the different database connection code for any language will stand out and we can go further than just "open a connection" and give simple insert and query code.

We have created a basic web application that is just enough to present a page for words and definitions and a small form to add words and definitions to that list. All the example code has to do is be able to serve up static web pages and have two endpoints; one that returns all the current words and definitions and one that takes and adds a new word and definition.

## Where to find the Grand Tour

The Compose Grand Tour has its own Github repository at [github.com/compose-grandtour](https://github.com/compose-grandtour) where you can download any one of language sets for a complete set of current database examples for that language. We'll be adding and enhancing the examples in the Grand Tour as it progresses and we invite you to give us your issues, feedback and your own takes on our Grand Tour examples. The journey begins here...
