Notebooks are where data scientists process, analyze, and visualize data in an iterative, collaborative environment. Having a scratchpad where you can write some code, iteratively work on some algorithms, and visualize the results quickly can speed the collaborative process.

As convenient as Jupyter Python notebooks are, sometimes it's better to collaborate with tools others find more familiar. For many people, that means JavaScript, in the form of Node.js.

[pixiedust_node](https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust_node) is an add-on for Jupyter notebooks that allows Node.js to run inside notebook cells. In fact, itâ€™s built on the popular PixieDust helper library.

## Getting started

Configuration is only two short notebook cells.

Now you're ready to fetch some data, in this case, from [a Cloudant database](https://examples.cloudant.com/cities).

Then use your favorite Node.js package to generate a data visualization.

In the context of a Jupyter notebook, you'll see your chart rendered like so:
