Before joining The Watson Data Lab, David was the lead architect for the Watson Core UI & Tooling team based in Littleton, Massachusetts. During that time, he led the design and development of a Unified Tooling Platform to support all the Watson Tools including accuracy analysis, test experiments, corpus ingestion, and training data generation. Before that, he was the lead architect for the Domino Server OSGi team responsible for integrating the eXpeditor J2EE Web Container in Domino and building first class APIs for the developer community. He started with IBM in 1996, working on various globalization technologies and products including Domino Global Workbench (used to develop multilingual Notes/Domino NSF applications) and a multilingual Content Management system for the Websphere Application Server. David enjoys sharing his experience by speaking at conferences. You’ll find him at various events like the Unicode conference, Eclipsecon, and Lotusphere. He’s also passionate about building tools that help improve developer productivity and overall experience.
