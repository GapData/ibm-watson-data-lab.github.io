Serverless computing puts as much computing power as is needed at any given moment, straight into the hands of the developers that need it.  By handling the provisioning and deployment as part of the platform, IBM Cloud Functions allows developers to focus only on the code that should be run in response to a given event, and deploy just that function.  Built on the open source OpenWhisk offering, IBM Cloud Functions is helping developers to ship faster and simpler.

The developer writes a function, and rather than deploying it to a server that is always running it is instead deployed to a serverless platform.  Developers only pay for the time their function is actually running, so no need to worry about paying for too much server capacity - or not enough.  This approach naturally encourages efficient coding and a modular approach, with each component in a self-contained "action".  With the modern microservices culture of many teams working on their own components, serverless is a great vehicle to the future.

## Responsive Computing

Rather than responding to a user requesting a page (although it can do that too), serverless "actions" usually run in response to an event.  This might be:
* a database change
* a webhook (e.g. from Slack or GitHub)
* a user submitting a form
* a message on a queue

With support for various programming languages built in, and the ability to package any other executables with Docker, this platform is for developers of all technology stacks and the good news is that all the services and datastores that you use on Bluemix?  They're available on IBM Cloud Functions too!  In this section you can find the resources you need to work effectively with the technologies you already know on a platform that grows as you do.
