Local Motors focuses on low-volume manufacturing of open-source vehicle designs, using multiple microfactories and a co-creation SaaS platform. IBM has partnered with Local Motors to make their autonomous bus, [Olli](https://localmotors.com/meet-olli/), smarter with Watson and the IBM Cloud. 

Olli is an all-electric, partially 3D-printed, self-driving vehicle with a cognitive rider experience. Holding up to 10 people, this autonomous shuttle is the result of a co-creation challenge and rapid prototyping.

To extend this work, a collaboration between Local Motors, IBM, the Consumer Technology Association, and 17 other partners, [#AccessibleOlli](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AccessibleOlli) was created. This 90-percent 3D-printed version of Olli uses technology to provide solutions for those with vision and hearing loss, cognitive disorders, and mobile constraints. Why? Because transportation can be a segregating experience for people with disabilities.

[#AccessibleOlli](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AccessibleOlli) debuted with great fanfare at [its recent unveiling at CES](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/iot-accessibleolli-drives-us-forward-at-ces/). But it's not just us driving its evolution. **You** are invited to contribute ideas, designs, and code on the [Local Motors Labs website](https://launchforth.io/localmotors/accessibleolli/latest/).
