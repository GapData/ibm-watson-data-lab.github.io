Offline First is an approach to app development in which apps are designed for the most resource-constrained environments *first*. An [Offline First app](/offline-first-apps) will not only work offline, but will also work better over an unreliable network connection, and even better over a solid one.

Just as Mobile First was about building for the smallest screen sizes first, Offline First is about targeting the most constrained network connectivity environments first. For many mobile apps, that means access to data.

An Offline First app stores its content and data directly on the local device for fast retrieval. Users can modify data while offline, and the app will synchronize changes to cloud copies when able.

The Offline First movement is bigger than IBM. It's a community of independent developers, UX professionals, makers &amp; builders, and companies like Google and IBM on a number of innovations. Join us.
