Serverless computing puts as much computing power as is needed at any given moment, straight into the hands of the developers that need it.  By handling the provisioning and deployment as part of the platform, [IBM Cloud Functions](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/) allows developers to focus only on the code that should be run in response to a given event, and deploy just that function.  Built on the open source OpenWhisk offering, IBM Cloud Functions is helping developers to ship faster and simpler.

When dealing with data, we're often looking to process a potentially large dataset. Using serverless technologies gives us access to a platform that can grow as our requirements do&mdash;and crucially, it costs nothing when it isn't in use. This dynamically sized, flexible approach is brilliant for data because it's a good fit, whether processing a large batch or handling/transforming streaming data. Costs are only incurred when the functions are being run, so making a platform available for occasional or temporary use is not a problem. Designing at the function level means naturally modular components, making for robust and maintainable systems.

## Responsive Computing

Rather than responding to a user requesting a page (although it can do that too), serverless "actions" usually run in response to an event. This might be:

* a database change
* a webhook (e.g. from Slack or GitHub)
* a user submitting a form
* a message on a queue

With support for various programming languages built in, and the ability to package any other executables with Docker, this platform is for developers of all technology stacks. And the good news is that all the services and datastores that you use on Bluemix?  They're available on IBM Cloud Functions too!  In this section you can find the resources you need to work effectively with the technologies you already know, on a platform that grows as you do.
