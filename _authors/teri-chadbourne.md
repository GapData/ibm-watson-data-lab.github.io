Teri Chadbourne is a community organizer for [Offline First](http://offlinefirst.org/) and co-organizer of [Offline Camp](http://offlinefirst.org/camp/) who spends her spare time leading event strategy for the Developer Advocacy team at IBM Watson Data Platform. A Certified Meeting Professional, Teri spent a past life planning events for web designers and developers at Future Insights. Now a novice front end web developer, she occasionally lends her coding skills to the team when not busy building websites to memorialize [elementary school bathroom chaos](http://toilettranscripts.com/). Teri also serves as personal assistant to our robot pal Marvin, who's the talk of the expo floor with his rock, paper, scissors skills.
