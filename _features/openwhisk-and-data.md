Serverless computing is a revolution, freeing developers from needing to provision servers and estimate load and allowing them to focus only on the tasks they need to compute.  The OpenWhisk platform behind IBM's Cloud Functions allows developers to write and deploy functions, and then run them on demand.  Developers can take any of the supported languages, and use the serverless platform as a springboard to performing scalable operations in a cost-effective and no-fuss way.

The architecture of serverless applications requires some different approaches from traditional applications, but the good news is that the support for the databases you already know and love (and indeed the ones you haven't tried yet) is just as good with IBM Cloud Functions as you'd expect in any other coding environment.  In this section you'll find resources for delivering your excellent work onto the platforms you can trust.

## Distributed Systems and Serverless Compute Power

Serverless computing is a gift for traditional applications but especially when there are workloads that would benefit from being parallelized, such as when processing large batches of data.  We bring you some examples for web developers and data scientists alike, sharing libraries, code snippets, and written tutorials so that you can participate in the fun.
