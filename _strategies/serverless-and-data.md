When dealing with data, we're often looking to process a potentially large dataset. Serverless technologies can grow as our requirements do&mdash;crucially, costs are only incurred when the functions are being run, so making a platform available for occasional or temporary use is not a problem.

This dynamically sized, flexible approach is brilliant for data because it's a good fit whether processing a large batch or handling/transforming streaming data. Designing at the function level means naturally modular components, making for robust and maintainable systems.
