Besides being one of the most talked about subjects worldwide, weather drives a lot of our decisions and influences **lots of stuff**. Imagine having weather data easily available to find out if your data is driven by the weather or use it to do predictions for next week. Here you can find examples of how we are exploring what you can do with weather data. 

## Weather Data

The first step is getting access to the data. There is a lot of it, so first you have to decide what you need. The options broadly are:
- historic weather
- current weather
- future weather  
All of these include variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, windspeed and many more.

There is quite some weather out there for free, but if you want a consistent dataset check out the IBM The Weather Company APIs on Bluemix or through their own [dataportal](). The APIs work as simple as doing a get request with the location (latitude, longitude) you are interested in that will   

For some more background check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Aq2cPxwss&list=PLGVZCDnMOq0oieXy92cJBwSirA3G2MCU1&index=6) where [Margriet](https://twitter.com/MargrietGr) explains a little more about weather and climate data and how to work with it. 

## Weather + Your Data

As we are constantly developing new ideas into data science projects and applications here are some of the ideas we are playing with at the moment and that might inspire you to explore if weather is something to add to your projects.

### Ongoing
- Collisions and Weather - analysis of traffic collisions in New York
- Global temperature and CO$_2$ concentration - time series analysis

### Ideas
- Location and Weather - add weather forecast to the Location Tracker
- Maps and Weather - build a notebook explaining how to work with weather gridded maps - add this functionality to PixieDust
- Geo and Weather - use weather data for geospatial statistics
- Health and Weather - 1. Hay fever and Weather - 2. Explore the influence of weather on the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue
- Food and Weather - build a simple crop production model in a notebook and test with observations. 
- Floods and Weather - build a flood warning API
- Hurricanes and Weather - build a hurricane warning API
- Holidays and Weather - 1. build a snow depth/wave height/sun hours/... model - 2. find my perfect location as specified by user and display pretty maps
- Water and Weather - predict drinking water availability
- Spring and Weather - why is spring starting earlier?
