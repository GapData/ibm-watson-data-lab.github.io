Watson Data Platform services need to work together well, but they're not going to work together well for everyone.

As developer advocates, we build libraries and tools that the core platform development teams don't (because they have a different focus). We identify gaps in our offerings and produce material that can plug the holes. Such code is produced to a professional standard, with automated tests and excellent documentation, as it is intended to be incorporated into others' projects.
