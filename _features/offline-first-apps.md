An Offline First approach can benefit any app that would typically require an internet connection. This includes Progressive Web Apps, hybrid mobile apps, native mobile apps, desktop apps, and even Internet of Things (IoT) apps. **IBM Cloudant and a set of related technologies can help you build Offline First apps.**

IBM Cloudant (or Apache CouchDB), Hoodie, and PouchDB are a great fit for Offline First **Progressive Web Apps**. A Progressive Web App combines the best parts both a web app and a native app. You browse to a Progressive Web App just like you browse to any other website. It lives at a URL, can be indexed by search engines, and can be linked to from anywhere else on the web. As you continue to use a Progressive Web App it gains additional native app-like capabilities. For example, the app could be installed to the home screen on your device. You might also grant the app the ability to send you push notifications, or the ability to access your camera, your microphone, or other device resources.

IBM Cloudant (or Apache CouchDB), Hoodie, and Cloudant Sync (or PouchDB) can also be used to build Offline First **hybrid mobile apps**, **native mobile apps**, **desktop apps**, or even **Internet of Things (IoT) apps**.

Learn how to use IBM Cloudant and Cloudant Sync to build an Offline First native mobile app with the [Location Tracker](/location-tracker) or the [Cloudant FoodTracker](/food-tracker) demo app.

Learn how to use PouchDB with hybrid mobile apps, desktop apps, or Internet of Things (IoT) apps:
