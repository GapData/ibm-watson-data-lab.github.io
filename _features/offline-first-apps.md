An Offline First approach can benefit any app that would typically require an internet connection. This includes Progressive Web Apps, hybrid mobile apps, native mobile apps, desktop apps, and even Internet of Things (IoT) apps.

IBM Cloudant (or Apache CouchDB), Hoodie, and PouchDB can be used to build Offline First **Progressive Web Apps**. A Progressive Web App combines the best parts both a web app and a native app. You browse to a Progressive Web App just like you browse to any other website. It lives at a URL, can be indexed by search engines, and can be linked to from anywhere else on the web. As you continue to use a Progressive Web App it gains additional native app-like capabilities. For example, the app could be installed to the home screen on your device. You might also grant the app the ability to send you push notifications, or the ability to access your camera, your microphone, or other device resources.

A **hybrid mobile app** is an app built with web platform technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript), but packaged up as a native app using a tool such as Ionic, Apache Cordova, or PhoneGap. IBM Cloudant (or Apache CouchDB), Hoodie, and Cloudant Sync (or PouchDB) can be used to build Offline First hybrid mobile apps.
