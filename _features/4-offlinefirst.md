# Offline First

## Design for your most constrained environment first&colon; an unreliable network.

A natural extension of Responsive web design and Mobile First thinking, which treat
screen size as your primary design constraint, Offline First treats the flakiness of
wireless networks as a given. Using the data replication and sync capabilities of Apache
CouchDB&#8482;, PouchDB, and IBM Cloudant, we'll show you how to build Offline First
principles into your apps so they're not only highly available, but load faster and
perform better too.
